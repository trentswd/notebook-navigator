## 3 Security and quality

Notebook Navigator is checked with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the official [Obsidian ESLint plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/eslint-plugin), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and a production build before changes are merged. The build must complete with zero errors and zero warnings.

Security checks run through [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/), with scan history in the [CodeQL workflow runs](https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator/actions/workflows/codeql.yml), and the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator). Current status is shown in the badges at the top of this page.

Notebook Navigator runs locally, but some features make documented HTTP requests for updates, downloads, and remote content. See [section 11 - Network and Diagnostics Disclosure](#11-network-and-diagnostics-disclosure) for the full list.

## 6 Synced and local settings

Many settings in Notebook Navigator display a sync toggle — a cloud icon that switches between "Enable sync" and "Disable sync". This controls where each setting is stored and whether it is shared across devices.

### 6.1 How sync works

Obsidian plugins store their configuration in `data.json`, located at `.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json` inside your vault folder. When you use a sync service — such as [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync), iCloud, GitHub, Dropbox, or Google Drive — this file is synchronized across all your devices along with the rest of your vault. Any setting saved to `data.json` will propagate to every device that syncs the vault.

<img width="606" height="48" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-18 at 22 58 05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d92458-1967-4008-acae-f722eee0d0a2" />

When sync is **enabled** (default) for a setting, the value is saved to `data.json` and synchronized to all devices through your sync service.

<img width="608" height="49" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-18 at 22 58 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6f4c839-f8b8-42b5-be43-1cb6c78abdb3" />

<br/>

When sync is **disabled** for a setting, the value is saved to Obsidian's local storage instead. Local storage is device-specific and is not included in vault sync. The setting will have its own independent value on each device. When you disable sync for a setting, the current value is copied to local storage on the current device, and the value is removed from `data.json` to prevent it from overriding local values on other devices.

If you do not use a sync service, the sync toggle has no practical effect since `data.json` is only stored locally.

## 7 Search

Notebook Navigator has two search modes: filter search and Omnisearch. Switch between them using the up/down arrow keys or by clicking the search icon. Combine file names, properties, tags, dates, and filters in one query (e.g., `meeting .status=active #work @thisweek`).

### 7.1 Filter search

Filters files by display name, alias, tags, properties, dates, folders, extensions, and tasks within the current folder and subfolders. Default search mode.

**File names and aliases**

- `word` - Match notes with "word" in the display name or an alias
- `word1 word2` - Require every word to match across the display name and aliases
- `-word` - Exclude notes with "word" in the display name or an alias
- `".F"` - Match text literally; a term that opens with a double quote is never interpreted as a tag, property, date, or filter (e.g., `".F"` matches names containing `.F` instead of filtering on a property)
- `-".F"` - Exclude notes with the literal text in the display name or an alias

**Tags**

- `#tag` - Include notes with tag (also matches nested tags like `#tag/subtag`)
- `#` - Include only tagged notes
- `-#tag` - Exclude notes with tag
- `-#` - Include only untagged notes
- `#tag1 #tag2` - Match both tags (implicit AND)
- `#tag1 AND #tag2` - Match both tags (explicit AND)
- `#tag1 OR #tag2` - Match either tag
- `#a OR #b AND #c` - AND has higher precedence: matches `#a`, or both `#b` and `#c`
- Cmd/Ctrl+Click a tag to add with AND. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Click to add with OR

**Properties**

- `.key` - Include notes with a property key that starts with `key`
- `.key=value` - Include notes where the property value contains `value`
- `."Reading Status"` - Property key with whitespace (double-quoted)
- `."Reading Status"="In Progress"` - Keys and values with whitespace must be double-quoted
- `-.key` - Exclude notes with a property key that starts with `key`
- `-.key=value` - Exclude notes where the property value contains `value`
- Cmd/Ctrl+Click a property to add with AND. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Click to add with OR

**Filters**

- `has:task` - Include notes with unfinished tasks
- `-has:task` - Exclude notes with unfinished tasks
- `folder:meetings` - Include notes where a folder name contains `meetings`
- `folder:/work/meetings` - Include notes only in `work/meetings` (not subfolders)
- `folder:/` - Include notes only in the vault root
- `-folder:archive` - Exclude notes where a folder name contains `archive`
- `-folder:/archive` - Exclude notes only in `archive` (not subfolders)
- `ext:md` - Include notes with extension `md` (`ext:.md` is also supported)
- `-ext:pdf` - Exclude notes with extension `pdf`
- Combine with tags, names, and dates (e.g., `folder:/work/meetings ext:md @thisweek`)

**Dates**

- `@today` - Match notes from today using the default date field
- `@yesterday`, `@last7d`, `@last30d`, `@thisweek`, `@thismonth` - Relative date ranges
- `@2026-02-07` - Match a single day (also supports `@20260207`)
- `@2026` - Match a calendar year
- `@2026-02` or `@202602` - Match a calendar month
- `@2026-W05` or `@2026W05` - Match an ISO week
- `@2026-Q2` or `@2026Q2` - Match a calendar quarter
- `@13/02/2026` - Numeric formats with separators (`@07022026` follows your locale when ambiguous)
- `@2026-02-01..2026-02-07` - Match an inclusive day range (open ends supported)
- `@c:...` or `@m:...` - Target created or modified date
- `-@...` - Exclude a date match

The default date field follows the current sort order. When sorting by name, the date field is configured in Settings → Notes → Date → When sorting by name.

**AND/OR behavior**

`AND` and `OR` operators work in tag/property-only queries (queries that contain only `#tag`, `-#tag`, `#`, `-#`, `.key`, `-.key`, `.key=value`, or `-.key=value` filters). If the query also includes names, dates, task filters, folder filters, or extension filters, `AND` and `OR` are matched as file name words instead.

- Operator query: `#work OR .status=started`
- Mixed query: `#work OR ext:md` (`OR` is matched in file names)

### 7.2 Omnisearch

Full-text search across the vault, filtered to the current folder, subfolders, or selected tags. Requires the [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin. If Omnisearch is not installed, search falls back to filter search.

Note previews show Omnisearch result excerpts instead of the default preview text.

**Known limitations**

- **Performance** - Can be slow when searching for fewer than 3 characters in large vaults
- **Path filters** - Folder scoping is sent to Omnisearch for all folder paths except names containing `"` or `,`. Folder names with non-ASCII characters require Omnisearch 1.30.0 or later. Results are always filtered to the current view after Omnisearch returns
- **Limited results** - Omnisearch returns at most 50 results. When searching in a folder, the limit covers the folder and its subfolders, so subfolder matches count toward the limit even when `Show notes from subfolders` is disabled
- **Preview text** - Note previews are replaced with Omnisearch result excerpts, which may not show the actual search match highlight if it appears elsewhere in the file

## 8 Custom hotkeys

Edit `.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json` to customize Notebook Navigator hotkeys. Open the file and locate the `keyboardShortcuts` section. Each entry maps an action to one or more key bindings:

```json
"pane:move-up": [ { "key": "ArrowUp", "modifiers": [] }, { "key": "K", "modifiers": [] } ]
```

Add multiple bindings per action to support alternate keys, like the `ArrowUp` and `K` example above. Combine modifiers in one entry by listing each value, for example `"modifiers": ["Mod", "Shift"]`. Keyboard sequences such as `gg` or `dd` are not supported. Reload Obsidian after editing the file.

### 8.1 Modifiers

| Modifier | Key                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Mod`    | Cmd (macOS) / Ctrl (Win/Linux)            |
| `Alt`    | Alt / Option                              |
| `Shift`  | Shift                                     |
| `Ctrl`   | Control (prefer `Mod` for cross-platform) |

### 8.2 Available actions

| Action                            | Default key(s)                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

## 9 Commands

Set custom hotkeys for these commands in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings:

**View & navigation**

- `Notebook Navigator: Open` Opens Notebook Navigator in left sidebar. If already open, moves keyboard focus over to the list pane. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E` to move keyboard focus to the list pane - **this is essential for full keyboard navigation**

- `Notebook Navigator: Open yearly note` Opens the current yearly note. Creates the note if it doesn't exist

**File operations**

**Important:** Obsidian has no context of "current folder or tag", so when creating notes in Obsidian by default they are created in the root folder, same folder as current file, or a specific folder. When working with Notebook Navigator you always want to create new notes in the currently selected folder or tag, so the first thing you should do is bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` so new notes are always created in the currently selected folder or tag. The same also applies to moving and deleting files. This is why you should use these commands instead of the built-in Obsidian commands when using Notebook Navigator.

- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` Create note in currently selected folder. **Suggestion:** Bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to this command (unbind from Obsidian's default "Create new note" first)
- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note from template` Create note from template in currently selected folder (requires Templater)
- `Notebook Navigator: Move files` Move selected files to another folder. Selects next file in current folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Merge notes` Create one note from selected Markdown notes in the current list order
- `Notebook Navigator: Convert to folder note` Create a folder matching the file name and move the file inside as the folder note
- `Notebook Navigator: Set as folder note` Rename the active file to its folder note name
- `Notebook Navigator: Detach folder note` Detach the folder note in the selected folder and rename it
- `Notebook Navigator: Pin all folder notes` Pin all folder notes in all folders. Command is only visible when folder notes are enabled
- `Notebook Navigator: Delete files` Delete selected files. Selects next file in current folder

**Tag operations**

- `Notebook Navigator: Add tag to selected files` Dialog to add tag to selected files. Supports creating new tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Set property on selected files` Dialog to set property on selected files
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove tag from selected files` Dialog to remove specific tag. Removes immediately if only one tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove all tags from selected files` Clear all tags from selected files with confirmation

**Maintenance**

- `Notebook Navigator: Rebuild cache` Rebuilds the local Notebook Navigator cache. Use this if you experience missing tags, incorrect previews or missing feature images
- `Notebook Navigator: Restore default settings` Replaces the settings file with verified defaults after saving a timestamped backup. This command is only available when Notebook Navigator cannot read its settings and stops during startup

- **Storage:** Writes a timestamped `nn-debug-...md` file in the vault root, then stops after startup settles. The file may sync if the vault root is synced.
- **Data:** Includes startup timing, plugin version, minimum supported Obsidian version, platform, cache counts, queue counts, IndexedDB status, and diagnostic errors. It does not include note contents, tag names, frontmatter values, or a list of vault files.
- **Paths and identifiers:** Startup initialization, PDF diagnostics, and error cases can include the Obsidian app/vault identifier, vault-relative PDF paths, or error stack details. Review and redact the file before sharing it publicly.
- **Upload:** Notebook Navigator does not upload debug files. They are shared only if you upload, attach, or sync them outside the plugin.

### 11.5 Privacy and data handling

- Notebook Navigator does not send note content, file names, tags, or debug files to a Notebook Navigator server.
- Requests to GitHub, YouTube, and any external image host are made directly from your device and include standard HTTP metadata (IP address, user-agent, and similar).
- Downloaded icon packs and images are stored locally (IndexedDB). Recent notes/files and UI state are stored locally (Obsidian local storage).
